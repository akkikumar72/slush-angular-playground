slush-angular-playground
========================

> A [slush](http://slushjs.github.io) generator for [angular-playground](https://github.com/russmatney/angular-playground),
a tiny angular app with live-reload intended for jumping quickly into a demo, blog post, presentation, hack-session, whatever.

## Get started

Install `slush-angular-playground` globally:

```bash
npm install -g slush-angular-playground
```

(If you haven't already):

```bash
npm install -g slush
```

## Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir angular-demo
cd angular-demo
slush angular-playground
```

Give that bad boy a name and then dive in.

```bash
gulp
```

`[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)`
